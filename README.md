Created in association with Working Group to Create Guidance Materials for NIH Data Management and Sharing Plans.
For more information, please visit [our OSF project](https://osf.io/uadxr/).

The example DMP directory was compiled from researchers, institutions,
libraries and workgroups who shared their data management plans online
from 2012-2022. This directory is intended to help researchers comply
with the new NIH policy and will not be updated after publishing.
